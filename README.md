# ADT Renaming Tool

This is just a simple C# console application I built beacuse I did not want to manually rename 30 ADT files. It will rename any ADT's in the directory it is executed in from oldname_x_y.adt to newname_x_y.adt. It will also rename any wdl and wdt file in the directory from oldname.(wdl/wdt) to newname.(wdl/wdt). 

## How to use it:
Using this tool is easy! Simply compile it and run the resulting executable in the directory where the adt's are, and the application will ask you for the new name.
